        <p class="lead mb-4">Hi, my name is Cathy Tran, eighteen years old, and I currently attend the University of California, Riverside. I am enrolled as a first year and my current major is pre - business. I have always known that I would enter as a business major and nothing else because there is nothing else that really interests me. Additionally, business is a very broad major, so there is a lot of time to discover what I truly want to do. A concentration that I was initially drawn to was marketing. Marketing was interesting for me because it has to do with a lot of creativity. For example, you always have to be thinking and creating content for your job. Additionally, marketing has a lot of group work, that means that you have to interact and work with a lot of people on a daily basis. Personally, I love working with people, especially in groups as I find it more fun and efficient. You can even become friends with the people you work with, which makes the job more fun, instead of having it strictly as a chore. However, recently, I changed my concentration to human resources. There were many factors that made me make this decision. First of all, I had a family relative that went to the University of California, Riverside and was an alumni. She asked me what I was thinking about my concentration, and I replied marketing. She mentioned how the concentration is very impacted and hard to get a job in the future with that concentration. That response made me rethink my decision slightly because marketing was something that still seemed interesting to me and I thought working hard will pay off. However, another relative of mine told me that I seem like I would be a great HR. At first, I did not know what HR was and she told me that it was Human Resources. She said that I would be a great fit because I am a sociable person and like talking to people. From there, I researched more about it and the job actually seemed very interesting as it has to do with working with people, which is what I  look for most in a job, cooperation and socializing. Thus, from there, I decided to change my concentration from marketing to human resources. Human resources seems very interesting as it has to do a lot with communicating with others, which I enjoy doing. Furthermore, a lot of people see me in this category, so I assume this would be something I am good at. A job that I am especially looking forward to is to become a Human Resources Manager. 
<br><br>

        Some things that I am good at would include how cooperative I am. Everyone can agree that I am a good student and that I like to study. I can say that I am a responsible and a hard-working student. Moreover, being a sociable person, I have many friends since I like to communicate with people and get to know new interesting individuals. I enjoy my time at school: it is really nice to study, the students are very friendly and ready to help. The atmosphere cannot but make me want to go there every time. I like to receive and deal with challenging tasks. I am a very enthusiastic student and I think this is a strong point of mine.My friends say that I am a very funny and interesting girl with a good sense of humor. As soon as I meet new people who are happy to meet me, I feel extremely comfortable with them. I believe that friendship is one of the most important values in human life. We exchange new ideas, find many interesting things about each other and experience new things. I appreciate friendship and people who surround me.
<br><br>

Meeting new people who support all my efforts to grow and develop my skills not only in the subjects but also in my hobbies gives me a lot of energy. Many of those friends who surround me now I met on the street while doing my hobby. Iâ€™m in love with photography, so the thing I love doing so much became even more enjoyable. I decided to take beautiful pictures of accidental people and share these photos with them by emails or in social media. I feel happiness inside seeing how happy they are looking at the pictures where they are walking or sitting somewhere in the park. In this way, Liza became my best friend and we both believe that we meant to meet because she studies the same classes and we have similar life goals.The goal Iâ€™m currently striving for is to make this world a better place to live in by starting the changes with myself. Sure, Iâ€™ve had bad experiences in my life too, but this is exactly what made me the way I am now: grateful, full of love, with a desire to study well because it will help me become a successful person in future and have a high quality of life. I believe that it is manifesting day by day and I feel even more responsibility for what I do and where I go. With all I already have, I know that Iâ€™m on the right path and I will do my best to inspire others to live the way they feel like living as well.
